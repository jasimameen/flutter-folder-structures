In this structure, the /features folder contains subfolders for each feature, and the contents of each feature folder are similar to what I described earlier. This approach can help to keep the root folder of the project more organized and easier to navigate, especially if there are many features in the app.


- app/: Contains code related to the overall application, such as the App widget and the application router.

- data/: Contains code related to data handling, such as data sources, repositories, and providers.

  - data_sources/: Contains classes that retrieve data from external sources, such as network APIs.

  - models/: Contains data models that are used by the application.

  - repositories/: Contains repositories that abstract away the data sources and provide a single interface for the use cases.

  - providers/: Contains providers for the data sources and repositories.

- domain/: Contains code related to the business logic of the application, such as entities, repositories, and use cases.

  - entities/: Contains domain entities that represent the data and business logic of the application.

  - repositories/: Contains repositories that define the interface for retrieving and updating data.

  - usecases/: Contains use cases that represent the interactions between the application and the outside world.

- presentation/: Contains code related to the presentation layer of the application, such as screens and widgets.

  - screens/: Contains the different screens of the application, such as the home screen and product details screen.

  - widgets/: Contains reusable widgets that are used by the screens.

  - providers/: Contains providers for the presentation layer, such as providers for the different screens.

In terms of where Riverpod locates in this folder structure, you can see that the data/providers/ and presentation/providers/ folders contain providers for the different parts of the application. These providers can be used to share state between different parts of the application, such as between a screen and a use case. The providers/ folder contains files that define these providers, such as data_providers.dart and presentation_providers.dart.
