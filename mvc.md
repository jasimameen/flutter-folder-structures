In this structure, the models folder contains the data models for the app, such as UserModel and ProductModel. The views folder contains the user interface (UI) for each screen in the app, such as HomeView and ProductView. The controllers folder contains the business logic for each screen, such as HomeController and ProductController. The providers folder contains the Riverpod providers for each data source in the app, such as UserProvider and ProductProvider.

This structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the app into three components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and business logic of the app, the view represents the user interface, and the controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.

In this structure, Riverpod is used for dependency injection. The providers folder contains the Riverpod providers for each data source in the app. These providers can be used to provide access to the data models in the models folder from the controllers and views in the app.

Note that this is just one example of how to structure an app using the MVC pattern and Riverpod. The specific folder structure and implementation will vary depending on the needs of the app and the preferences of the developers.
