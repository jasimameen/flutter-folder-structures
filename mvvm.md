MVVM Flutter App
This is an example Flutter app that follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. The app is structured into separate folders for models, views, viewmodels, services, and providers.

Folder Structure
The folder structure for this app is as follows:


|-- lib/
    |-- main.dart
    |-- models/
        |-- user_model.dart
        |-- product_model.dart
    |-- views/
        |-- home_view.dart
        |-- login_view.dart
        |-- product_view.dart
        |-- cart_view.dart
    |-- viewmodels/
        |-- home_viewmodel.dart
        |-- login_viewmodel.dart
        |-- product_viewmodel.dart
        |-- cart_viewmodel.dart
    |-- services/
        |-- user_service.dart
        |-- product_service.dart
        |-- cart_service.dart
    |-- providers/
        |-- user_provider.dart
        |-- product_provider.dart
        |-- cart_provider.dart
        
models/
This folder contains the data models for the app. Each model corresponds to a different data entity in the app, such as UserModel and ProductModel.

views/
This folder contains the user interface (UI) for each screen in the app. Each view corresponds to a different screen in the app, such as HomeView and ProductView.

viewmodels/
This folder contains the view models for each screen in the app. Each view model corresponds to a different screen in the app, such as HomeViewModel and ProductViewModel. The view models act as intermediaries between the views and the models, and contain the business logic and data binding for the views.

services/
This folder contains the business logic and network calls for each data source in the app. Each service corresponds to a different data source in the app, such as UserService and ProductService. The services interact with the models to get and update data.

providers/
This folder contains the Riverpod providers for each data source in the app. Each provider corresponds to a different data source in the app, such as UserProvider and ProductProvider. The providers are used for dependency injection, and provide access to the services and models from the view models.
